        <h2>About Conspiracy Theories</h2>
        <div class="aboutBox" id="text">
            <p>
            Conspiracy theories go back a long time, but were not understood or studied as a phenomenon until after World War II. There is even evidence of a conspiracy theory that took place as far back as 331 BCE.The first use of the term "conspiracy theory" appears to have been in a paper in 1870, though it was not a fully fleshed out idea at that point. Conspiracy theories can be found in every corner of the world and are not unique to the United States or Western Cultures.<br><br>
            From the BBC Article, What we can Learn from Conspiracy Theories:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200522-what-we-can-learn-from-conspiracy-theories">
                "From alien lizard rulers to shark attacks instigated by spies and elaborate multi-billion-dollar hoaxes, the menagerie of conspiracy theories in existence is so bizarre, the reasons some take off – and others vanish without a trace – may seem almost random. There’s even a conspiracy theory about how conspiracy theories were invented (in keeping with the standard conspiracy formula, the CIA were allegedly involved)." [<a href="#2">2</a>]
            </blockquote> 
            Conspiracy Theories can be broken down into types, though there are a number of theories about how to classfiy conspiracy theories. Marcy Pauly gives a breakdown of several ways to classify the different types of conspiracy theory [<a href="#3">3</a>]
            <ul>
                <li>
                    * Identify them as being political (having some sort of political target or aim) or non-political. This classification system is somewhat limited.<br>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    * Break conspiracy theories into scientific vs. non-scientific, ideological vs. neutral, and alternative explanations vs. denial.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    * The last way is to define conspiracy theories by the type of real or theoretical object to which they refer.
                </li><br>
            </ul> 
            This site uses the latter method to attempt to classify or group conspiracy theories. We have broken down conspiracy theories into 4 broad categories: Organized Crime, Political, Environmental, and Extraterrestrial. Each of those categories include a more detailed description of some of the most well known or interesting consipracy theories within the category.

            <h3>Definition</h3>
            Merriam Webster defines a conspiracy theory as: a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators; also : a theory asserting that a secret of great importance is being kept from the public. [<a href="#1">1</a>]
