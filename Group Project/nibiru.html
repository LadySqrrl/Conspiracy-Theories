            The conspiracy theory about a planet that was on a collision course, about to destroy the Earth began with a story written in 1976 by Zecharia Sitchin. In "The Twelfth Planet", there was a planet, called Nibiru, orbits the sun every 3,600 years. According to the author's translations of Summerian cuneiform, The planet is supposedly home to a race of aliens who were in contact with the ancient Summerians the last time the planet came nearby. 
            <br><br>
            Several years later, a psychic claimed that she had been contacted by the aliens of Nibiru and that they had informed her that their planet would collide with Earth in 2003. When the collision failed to occur in 2003, the date was moved back to 2012, which added a link to the theory that the end of the Mayan long-count period meant the world would end. In 2011, Commet Elenin appeared, whic further fed the fears that the "killer planet" was really on its way. The world did not end in 2012, but that has not persuaded the most hard-core Nibiru believers. Some people still believe it is out there and will destroy our planet someday.
            <br><br>
            There is one very good explanation for why the theory that there is a planet on its way to collide with Earth: any planet that had a 3,600 year orbit and was on a path to collide with Earth anytime soon would be not only visible to astronomers, but would be visible with the naked eye. It would appear brighter than most stars and other planets.
