            The conspriacy theory that the moon landing was faked was started by a man named Bill Kaysing, who wrote a self-published pamphlet in 1976 claiming that there was no possible way that the moon landing had really happened. Kaysing had previously worked for a company that helped designe the Saturn V rockets, which helped solidify his credibility in the minds of many conspiracy theorists. And the conspiracy theory is still alive and well today. A wide variety of surveys have been conducted that show between 6 and 20% of Americans believe the moon landing was a hoax with political motives. 
            <br><br>
            One question is why. As the Cold War was heating up, the U.S. appeared to be siginficantly behind the Soviets in the race to put a man on the moon. While the U.S.S.R. had launched both Sputnik 1 and 2, the U.S. space program barely existed. It went from nothing to putting a man in space within 3 years. When John F. Kennedy announced that the U.S. would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade, it seemed like it was unlikely that goal would be met. And yet, they succeeded. Beating the Soviets to the moon was important to both the technological and social/psychological aspects of the Cold War. 
            People who believe the moon landing was a hoax have a variety of claims that they say support their theory. One claim is that the flag in the photo appears to be flapping in the wind. But the moon does not have an atmosphere and, therefore, does not have wind. NASA says that is true, which is why the flags that were taken to the moon to be planted in the lunar soil contained a horizontal rod that held the flag out. If not, the flag would hang limp and would not be easily identified as the U.S. flag. When the flag was taken to plant in the moon, the astronauts had trouble extending the horizontal rod, which gives it the appearance of being crumpled as though it's blowing in the wind.<br><br>

            Another claim is that you can't see stars in the pictures taken on the moon. This claim is also easily debunked because there is a simple reason that the photos don't show the stars: they were taken during lunar daylight. The surface of the moon was being lit by the sun. That along with the bright white reflective space suits made it difficult for the cameras that the astronauts had with them to capture the stars. <br><br>

            A thrid claim is that the shadows in the images of the moon landing are wrong. The claim says that because there is only one source of light on the moon (the sun), the items in shadow should not be visible. Theorists assert that the only way to view the images in shadow would be with multiple light sources (such as on a Hollywood film set). However, the sun is not the ONLY source of ilumination on the moon. Light is reflected up from the lunar surface (which is how we see the moon as "shining"). <br><br>

            There are other arguments that are made that assert that the moon landing was faked, but those claims are generally easily refuted. The evidence that the moon landing did, actually, occur is extensive. The evidence inclues 328kg of lunar rock that was collected on the moon landing missions, evidecne of the tracks made by humans on the moon's surface, and the fact that Russia, China, and Japan have all corroborated the 1969 moon landing. And given that the motive was to beat the U.S.S.R. in the race to the moon, it seems especially compelling that they confirm that the landing did, in fact, occur. Despite all the evidence, though, there are still plenty of people who question whether the moon landing really happened.
