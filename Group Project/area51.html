            Area 51 is a military base locacted at Groom Lake in Southern Nevada. It was 2013 before the federal government recognized the existence of Area 51. That combined with the fact that it has never been accessible to the public, satelite imagery was banned, and that the only way in and out was by secret, unmarked plane has certainly led to the plethora of consipiracy theories that surround the mysterious base. The claim that the secrecy surrounding Area 51 is related to national security seems to only further the belief that the government is hiding something, and for many people, that something is aliens. <br><br>

            Area 51 was used for the development of a high-altitude reconnaissance program to build spy planes. The nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union fueled the desire to be able to spy from high altitude. In 1955, the U-2 spy plane was developed and testing began at Area 51. The fact that the government was building and testing secret spycraft is the likely explanation for why people repoorted seeing unidentified flying objects (UFOs) around the area. In fact, the CIA even encouraged the rumors of UFO sightings to obfuscate what the real purpose of Area 51 was. Aliens conspiracy theories were a good cover to explain never-before-seen high tech aircraft that was being tested in the area. <br><br>

            Another reason that the belief that Area 51 was secretly studying Alien technology began in 1980 with the publication of the book The Roswell Incident. In 1947, there was an icident of an unidentified craft was spotted in Roswell. At the time, there was some public interest, but the conspiracy theory did not really take off until The Roswell Incident. The book played into the "occult paranoia" of the 1980s and lit the conspiracy spark. In 1994, the government revealed that the item seen at Roswell was a nuclear surveilance balloon, but that didn't stop the rumors. Theories that aliens had landed and the government was secretly experimenting on them really took off after a 1989 interview with Robert Lazar, who worked near Area 51. In the interview, Lazar said that Area 51 was designed solely to capture, house, and study aliens. He claimed to have seen photos of alien autopsies. Aliens visiting our planet and the Area 51 conspiracy have become a cultural trope, seen in TV and movies frequently.<br><br>

            To this day, the ongoing activities at Area 51 are kept secret. Information about the existance and purpose of Area 51 was not released until 2013, the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Until that point, the government had never acknowledged the existence of Area 51. And in 2017, the Pentagon revealed that there is a DOD project in place to track and investigate reports of UFOs. Due to the continued secrecy and the admission of a government program related to UFOs, it's unlikely the Area 51 alien conspiracy theory will be disappearing anytime soon. <br class="clear">
